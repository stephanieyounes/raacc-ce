And our mission statement is
 Our mission is to join and inspire modern efforts aimed to marry the natural environment and the culture, values, and needs of the local community by implementing the most up-to-date and nature-based solutions to civil engineering problems and projects. ​

​

Our vision is to create a community where the natural world and its creations exist in a mutualistic relationship with humanity and its creations. We work to see a world that changes the narrative of new construction as taking away from the earth, to an engineered process of giving back to and improving it. ​
